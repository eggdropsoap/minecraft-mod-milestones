Since the project is currently under development, there is no license yet.
Once it reaches release quality, it will likely be licensed under a CC license of some variety.

In case that doesn't make it clear, that means that the code is currently copyrighted and may
not be copied or redistributed, regardless of whether you can see it in the repo.
